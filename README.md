Project Objective
In this project, we investigate a dataset that carries approximate facts about restaurant chains all over the world. The project's main aim is to perform descriptive and statistical analysis based on a few designed goals.

Dataset
The dataset provides crucial information such as the average cost for two, location, votes, aggregate rating, cuisines, country, and rating text. Various analyses, including identifying top cuisines, most expensive restaurants, average rating for each country, and many others, are performed on this dataset.
The dataset's owner is Zomato, and Kaggle is the source providing the data.

Zomato Analysis
Load the Raw Data: Initial loading of the dataset into a usable format.
Data Cleaning: Performed using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
Data Preparation: Ensured data quality by:
Dropping unnecessary columns.
Dropping duplicate rows.
Cleaning individual rows for consistency.
Ready for Dashboard: The cleaned data is now prepared for developing an interactive dashboard.
Key Questions
The analysis we are going to perform aims to answer the following questions:

What are the total number of restaurants and cuisines available worldwide?
Which countries have the greatest number of restaurants enrolled in Zomato?
Which cities in India have the greatest number of "value for money" restaurants?
What are the top 10 cuisines with the highest number of votes in India?
Which countries have restaurants that offer online delivery?
In terms of the number of restaurants, which locality has the most restaurants?
Which restaurants offer good cuisine and an average rating?

Conclusion
The analysis reveals insights into restaurants with the highest cost for two, countries with a greater number of restaurants on Zomato, countries offering online delivery, and average aggregate ratings per country.
Based on our findings, restaurants in different localities can enhance their quality, offer online delivery, improve services on days with average aggregate ratings, and study successful "value-added" restaurants. Implementing strategies like combining online delivery with table booking and offering diverse cuisines can significantly improve their appeal.
The insights make it easier for frequent visitors to filter restaurants based on criteria such as average cost for two, votes, aggregate rating, and cuisines, aiding their decision-making before visiting.
